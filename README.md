# Minesweeper
A simple recreation of minesweeper.

Note: The code is rough and poorly designed due to this being built in a game-jam mindset.

## Requirements
* Java 16+

## Build
Execute `./build.sh` this will create a jar file in the root called `minesweeper.jar`

## Run
Execute `java -jar minesweeper.jar`.

## Controls
  1. Left Click - Reveal tile
  2. Right Click - Place/remove flag
  3. Esc - Return to menu

Highlight mode may be enabled to highlight the squares surrounding the tile under the mouse.
This can help with understanding the number hints.
